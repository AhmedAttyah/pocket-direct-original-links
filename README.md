#Access Pocket Original Links Directly

 Directly click on your saved links from Homepage in getpocket.com (formerly ReadItLater) without loading the annoying short description page and then click on view original for every single link


## Why i made this extension ?
i was annoyed by getpocket.com interface, i had to click twice to load one more page (description)   to be able to click on original link, that was very annoying, and time consuming if you have many links.

## How to Install


* 1- clone this repositoty, then go to (chrome://extensions/) and check to enable developer mode on the top then click on load unpacked extension and choose the cloned project folder.

* 2- you can [Download the Extension from here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1114321/pocket-direct-link-chrome-extension.crx), then go to (chrome://extensions/) and check to enable developer mode on the top, then drag .crx file into this tab, and click add, and restart chrome, you will a blue correct image under the link when original link fetching is done.
