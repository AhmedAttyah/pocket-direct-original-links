#Access Pocket Original Links Directly

 Directly click on your saved links from Homepage in getpocket.com (formerly ReadItLater) without loading the annoying short description page and then click on view original for every single link


## Why i made this extension ?
i was annoyed by getpocket.com interface, i had to click twice to load one more page (description)   to be able to click on original link, that was very annoying, and time consuming if you have many links.

## How it works 

you can [Download the Extension from here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1114321/pocket-direct-link-chrome-extension.crx) or clone this repoistory, then drag .crx file into any chrome tab, and click add, you will a blue correct image under the link when original link fetching is done.

## Future work
* this was a very initial version and a proof of concept.
* writing tests.
* the extension currently supports only homepage, will add support of all other pages which are loaded with ajax, and also add support for dynamic scrolling.

## Contibute
as i always say feel free to fork this process and push any modifications.
